# VVZ_extension  
Browser extension for a better user experience when using https://vvz.ethz.ch.  

## Features:  

### Timetable Creator
You can add courses while browsing through VVZ and then display a timetable like you would see in MyStudies. Helpful to check for any overlaps for your upcoming semester or if you just wanna see how your timetable will look like somewhat.

### Keep Structure in VVZ Search Menu:  
Whenever you switch semester vvz removes any selections you already made under Structure. This feature allows you to keep them and easily search through different semesters.  

### Filter for type of grading:  
While searching you can filter for Session examination, End of semester examination and (un)graded Semester performance.

### Easier Search:
Have all the information you want in the search results instead of having to click through each course.

### CourseReview:  
Replaces all course_ids with links to https://n.ethz.ch/~lteufelbe/coursereview/course/course_id/ to easily check out reviews of a course.  
You can also see Star ratings from CourseReview right while browsing VVZ. 


## Known Issues:  
This extension makes extra requests to vvz to filter and keep the structure. This can lead fast to 403s. So you shouldn't spam use the features if you would like to use them.
