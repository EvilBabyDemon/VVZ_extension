# VVZ_extension  
Browser extension for a better user experience when using https://vvz.ethz.ch.  

## Features:  

### Keep Structure in VVZ Search Menu:  
Whenever you switch semester vvz removes any selections you already made under Structure. This feature allows you to keep them and easily search through different semesters.  

### Filter for type of grading:  
While searching you can filter for Session examination, End of semester examination and (un)graded Semester performance.

### CourseReview:  
Replaces all course_ids with links to https://n.ethz.ch/~lteufelbe/coursereview/course/course_id/ to easily check out reviews of a  course.  

## Known Issues:  
This extension makes extra requests to vvz to filter and keep the structure. This can lead fast to 403s. So you shouldn't spam use the features if you would like to use them.
