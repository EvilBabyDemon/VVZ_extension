ToDo:

Back button to last search
- once you are on a course page in VVZ as openening the categories make the browser back button useless

~~Link to course from last year~~\
git diff for the different years of a course?

Make the stats clickable to get to the website too

Change from `enter` to `shift + enter`?

when saving course names make sure to always use german version

~~show if the review site has actual written reviews so you don't open it just to see the scores again~~

Put the rating columns all into one -> 5 / 3.5 / 3 / 1 / 4.8
- over hover show precise text
- add icon to indicate if review exists or not


change var to let, smaller scope -> better to not shadow accidentally
